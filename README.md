# SERN-Todolist-Typescript
this is the project im currently working on to gain familiarity with working with REST APIS and tailwindcss:

## Main technologies in use
- S: MySQL(DB)
- E: Expressjs(RestAPI)
- R: Reactjs(a javascript/typescript front end library)
- N: Node.js(javascript runtime environment being used for backend/server work)

## Current Progress

- Front page design and backend api hookup
